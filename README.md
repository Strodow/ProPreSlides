# ProPreSlides
Propresenter lacks some features that I think would be very useful. The way this will interact with propresenter is either by exported bundle or the default propresenter file storage location /documents/propresenter.

## Requirements
- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/)
- [Google Protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/master/python)
- [pyspellchecker](https://pypi.org/project/pyspellchecker/)
- [.proto files](https://github.com/greyshirtguy/ProPresenter7-Proto)

## Goals
- Spell checker
- Cleaning bible verse slides (spaces after periods, removeing pipe (|) character)
- Image management (remove images that are no longer being used)
- Presentation statistics (file sizes, number of presentations, )
- Templated songs (have a main song that will be ripple edit only text)
